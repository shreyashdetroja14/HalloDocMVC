The fact that Eren says "I'm the same as you" but Reiner still believes that he's the wrong one is what makes this absolute peak of all Parallels in AoT. 
Reiner as a brainwashed person comes to paradise in order to destroy the eldians because Reiner didn't have much choice and Reiner chooses his family over humanity and Eren becomes the victim of this brainwashed person. Getting dead inside from guilt Reiner believes that it's because of him everyone suffered in paradise but then on the other hand you have Eren who understands that "Reiner didn't have much choice,  what could a kid like him have done?" He just choose to protect his family but now Eren is doing the same,  Eren  chooses his family over his humanity too, Reiner is suffering, but Eren doesn't care anymore, Eren suffered too when Reiner invaded paradise, Reiner was trying to save the world(for him the world was his family)  Eren will save the world too(for him, the paradise), Eren sees himself in Reiner, but Reiner doesn't see himself in anyone and thus Eren says I'm the same as you, because just like Reiner, Eren is just protecting his loved ones and is moving forward in order to attain his freedom destroying whichever enemy that comes in his way. 
While Reiner has lost his perspective and has stopped moving forward, Eren has gained a perspective and is moving forward. 
The main parallel is that Reiner blames himself for the massacre but Eren understands that it wasn't Reiner's fault, it was just Marley forcing him and at the same point Eren says I'm the same as you implying that what he was about to do is not his fault either, it's Marley turning him into the monster that they call him.
